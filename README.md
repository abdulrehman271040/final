#Gethub Actions
- GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- we can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
- Full-featured: Real-time Preview, Image (cross-domain) upload, Preformatted text/Code blocks/Tables insert, Code fold, Search replace, Read only, Themes, Multi-languages, L18n, HTML entities, Code syntax highlighting...;
#YML
A YML file is a text document that contains data formatted using YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data format used for data serialization. It is used for reading and writing data independent of a specific programming language.

##Building C++ Gradle
Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that is designed to be flexible enough to build almost any type of software.
Gradle has general support for the three major tool chains on major operating system: Clang, GCC and Visual C++.

##Testing  C++ Gradle

The C++ Unit Test Plugin provides the tasks, configurations and conventions for integrating with a C++ executable-based testing framework, Gradle executes tests in a separate ('forked') JVM, isolated from the main build process. This prevents classpath pollution and excessive memory consumption for the build process. It also allows you to run the tests with different JVM arguments than the build is using.

#C++ file in Github
- The main purpose of the file is to demonstrate the GitHub Actions of building and testing c++ using Gradle. 
- The popular line "Hello World" is output by the code. The task of building and testing c++ with Gradle is completed on execution.
